I’m Yuxiao, currently a master student at Tsinghua University. I’m interested in human-centric computer graphics and vision problems, e.g. full body recovery from RGB images (my bachelor thesis). I received my bachelor degree at Tsinghua University in 2019.

In my daily life, I enjoy cycling and running.
